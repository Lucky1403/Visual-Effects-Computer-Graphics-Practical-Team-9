## 📝 Practicals Covered

### 6️⃣ Adding Foliage, Fire, and Smoke with Paint Effects
- Created foliage, fire, and smoke effects using paint-style brushes/tools.  
- Demonstrated the ability to place and customize environmental effects.

### 7️⃣ Creating Water, Smoke and Sparks with nParticles
- Used nParticles to simulate dynamic water, smoke, and spark effects.  
- Controlled particle attributes such as lifetime, size, and turbulence.

### 8️⃣ Generating nParticle Swarms and Bubble Masses with Expressions
- Generated swarms and bubble-like masses by attaching expressions to nParticles.  
- Showed custom particle behavior through scripting.

### 9️⃣ Simulating Semi-Rigid and Rigid Debris with Python
- Wrote Python scripts to control semi-rigid and rigid debris simulations.  
- Automated creation and interaction of debris objects for visual effects.

### 🔟 Motion Tracking with Matchmover
- Imported real-world footage into Blender.  
- Tracked multiple feature points and solved the camera motion.  
- Inserted 3D elements into the tracked footage and rendered final MP4 output.
